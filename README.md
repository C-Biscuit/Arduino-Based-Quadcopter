# Arduino-Based-Quadcopter

    This project outlines and details the designs of an arduino based quadcopter that recieves commands over bluetooth from an android application. The quadcopter features a 9 Axis IMU and GPS to execute flight routines. 
    In this project there will be documentaion on Pin Connections,  details on initiallizing used devices, and code files used for programming the arduino and related devices.
    The first segment of this project is the Pin Connections on the arduino.
